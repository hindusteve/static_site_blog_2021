The last few days have mostly been installing the required software for the Django tutorial. No big surprises there. I opted to potentially go off script of the learning path Ben had put together, b/c I felt like learning to use Django effectively would be more important to what I am trying to accomplish right now. I started lesson 1 a couple of days ago, and lesson 2 yesterday. It has been a bit more challenging than I expected - part of me feels like I want the tutorial to be a little more basic than it is. But I'll keep plugging away, and see about re-reading the lessons daily, to really drive home the learning. But my initial feeling is that I am just following instructions, and not sure of the degree to which I'm actually learning/retaining.
(to be continued...)
